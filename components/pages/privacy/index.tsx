                    satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or

                    a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we
                    reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in
                    respect to our relationship with you.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                Vultisig takes the protection of your personal data very
                seriously. We have put in place appropriate technical,
                organizational, physical, electronic and managerial security
                measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally
                lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or
                disclosed, including use of secure servers, passwords and
                industry standard encryption for data both in transit and at

              <p>
                When first launching the App, it creates an individual encrypted
                digital wallet, i.e. a private key, for every user to store
                his/her crypto assets. Vultisig does not have, at any point in
                time, access to the user’s private keys and funds. You are
                responsible for keeping your private key confidential. We ask
                you not to share your private key with anyone. If you lose or
                give away your private key, you lose or give away your crypto
                assets.
              </p>
              <p>
                We limit access to your personal data to those employees,

                need to know. They will only process your personal data on our

                We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected

                As a data subject you have a number of rights in relation to
                your personal data. Below, we have described the various rights
                that you have as well as how you can exercise them (provided
                that the applicable conditions are met and subject applicable
                statutory exceptions).

                  9.1 Right of Access
                  <p>
                    You may, at any time, request access to the personal data
                    that we hold which relates to you (you may have heard of
                    this right being described as a “subject access request”).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Please note that this right entitles you to receive a copy
                    of the personal data that we hold about you in order to
                    enable you to check that it is correct and to ensure that we
                    are processing that personal data lawfully. It is not a
                    right that allows you to request personal data about other
                    people, or a right to request specific documents from us
                    that do not relate to your personal data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can exercise this right at any time by writing to us
                    (info@vultisig.com) and telling us that you are making a
                    “subject access request”. You do not have to fill in a
                    specific form to make this kind of request.

                <li>
                  9.2 Your Right to Rectification and Erasure
                  <p>
                    You may, at any time, request that we correct personal data
                    that we hold about you which you believe is incorrect or
                    inaccurate. Please note that we may ask you to verify any
                    new personal data that you provide to us and may take our
                    own steps to check that the new data you have supplied us
                    with is right.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You may also ask us to erase personal data that we control
                    if you do not believe that we need to continue retaining it
                    (you may have heard of this right described as the “right to
                    be forgotten”). Although we will do everything to respect
                    your request and personal data, it may not always be
                    possible to erase all of your personal data as there may be
                    legal requirements to keep certain personal data or
                    technical limitations to the data we can delete.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There may also be legitimate interests in keeping certain
                    personal data including, amongst others, if the personal
                    data is required for the App to function. If this is the
                    case, we will continue to process this personal data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If erasure is not technically possible or we believe that we
                    have a good legal reason to continue processing personal
                    data that you ask us to erase, we will tell you this and our
                    reasoning at the time we respond to your request.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can exercise this right at any time by writing to us
                    (info@vultisig.com) and telling us that you are making a
                    request to have your personal data rectified or erased and
                    on what basis you are making that request. If you want us to
                    replace inaccurate data with new data, you should tell us
                    what that new data is. You do not have to fill in a specific
                    form to make this kind of request.

                </li>
                <li>
                  9.3 Your Right to Restrict Processing
                  <p>
                    Where we process your personal data on the basis of a
                    legitimate interest, you are entitled to ask us to stop
                    processing it in that way if you feel that our continuing to
                    do so impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms or if
                    you feel that those legitimate interests are not valid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You may also ask us to stop processing your personal data
                    (a) if you dispute the accuracy of that personal data and
                    want us verify that data’s accuracy; (b) where it has been
                    established that our use of the data is unlawful but you do
                    not want us to erase it; (c) where we no longer need to
                    process your personal data (and would otherwise dispose of
                    it) but you wish for us to continue storing it in order to
                    enable you to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Please note that if for any reason we believe that we have a
                    good legal reason to continue processing personal data that
                    you ask us to stop processing, we will tell you what that
                    reason is, either at the time we first respond to your
                    request or after we have had the opportunity to consider and
                    investigate it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can exercise this right at any time by writing to us
                    (info@vultisig.com) and telling us that you are making a
                    request to have us stop processing the relevant aspect of
                    your personal data and describing which of the above
                    conditions you believe is relevant to that request. You do
                    not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of
                    request.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  9.4 Your Right to Portability
                  <p>
                    Where you wish to transfer certain personal data that we
                    hold about you, which is processed by automated means, to a
                    third party, you may write to us and ask us to provide it to
                    you in a commonly used machine-readable format.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because of the kind of work that we do and the systems that
                    we use, we do not envisage this right being particularly
                    relevant to the majority of individuals with whom we
                    interact. However, if you wish to transfer your data from us
                    to a third party we are happy to consider such requests.

                  9.5 Your Right to object to processing
                  <p>
                    You may object to processing of your personal data where we
                    rely on legitimate interest for processing that personal
                    data. We will comply with your request unless we have a
                    compelling overriding legitimate interest for processing or
                    we need to continue processing your personal data to
                    establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.

                  <p>
                    To unsubscribe from receiving marketing messages at any
                    time, please click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of
                    any marketing email and update your notification preferences
                    in the App. For details on your rights to ask us to stop
                    sending you various kinds of communications, please contact
                    us (info@vultisig.com).

                    9.6.1 8.7 Your Right to object to automated Decision Making
                    and Profiling You have the right to be informed about the
                    existence of any automated decision making and profiling of
                    your personal data, and where appropriate, be provided with
                    meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as
                    the significance and the envisaged consequences of such
                    processing that affects you.

                  <p>
                    Where we are relying on consent to process your personal
                    data, you may withdraw consent at any time. However, this
                    will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out
                    before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your
                    consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or
                    services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at
                    the time you withdraw your consent.

                  9.8 Exercising your rights
                  <p>
                    When you write to us making a request to exercise your
                    rights, we are entitled to ask you to prove that you are who
                    you say you are. We may ask you to provide copies of
                    relevant ID documents to help us to verify your identity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It will help us to process your request if you clearly state
                    which right you wish to exercise and, where relevant, why it
                    is that you are exercising it. The clearer and more specific
                    you can be, the faster and more efficiently we can deal with
                    your request. If you do not provide us with sufficient
                    information, then we may delay actioning your request until
                    you have provided us with additional information (and where
                    this is the case, we will tell you).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For contact information to make a request or exercise your
                    right, see also below under section 11.

              <p>
                We use various techniques on our Website that allow us and third
                parties engaged by us to recognize you during your use of our
                Website and possibly to track you across several visits. This
                Section informs you about this.
              </p>
              <p>
                In essence, we wish to distinguish access by you (through your
                system) from access by other users, so that we can ensure the
                functionality of the website and carry out analysis and
                personalization. We do not intend to determine your identity,
                even if that is possible where we or third parties engaged by us
                can identify you by combination with other data. However, even
                without registration data, the technologies we use are designed
                in such a way that you are recognized as an individual visitor
                each time you access the website, for example by our server (or
                third-party servers) that assign a specific identification
                number to you or your browser (so-called «cookie»).
              </p>
              <p>
                Cookies are individual codes (for example a serial number) that
                our server or a server of our service providers or advertising
                partners transmits to your system when you connect to our
                website, and that your system (browser, cell phone) accepts and
                stores until the set expiration time. Your system transmits
                these codes to our server or the third-party server with each
                additional access. That way, you are recognized even if your
                identity is unknown.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whenever you access a server (for example when you use the
                Website , or because an e-mail includes a visible or invisible
                image), your visits can therefore be «tracked». If we integrate
                offers from an advertising partners or a provider of an analysis
                tool on our Website they may track you in the same way, even if
                you cannot be identified in a particular case.

              <p>
                We use these technologies on our Webite and may allow certain
                third parties to do so as well. However, depending on the
                purpose of these technologies, we may ask for consent before
                they are used. You can access and change your current settings
                here[link]. You can also set your browser to block or deceive
                certain types of cookies or alternative technologies, or to
                delete existing cookies. You can also add software to your
                browser that blocks certain third-party tracking. You can find
                more information on the help pages of your browser (usually with
                the keyword «Privacy») or on the websites of the third parties
                set out below.

                  Google Analytics: Google LLC is the provider of the service
                  «Google Analytics». For the purposes of the GDPR and the
                  Australian Data Protection Act (DPA), Google Ireland Ltd. is
                  the controller (both «Google»). Google tracks the behavior of
                  visitors to our Website (duration, page views, geographic
                  region of access etc.) through performance cookies (see above)
                  and on this basis creates reports for us about the use of our
                  Website. We have configured the service so that the IP
                  addresses of visitors are truncated by Google in Europe before
                  forwarding them to the United States and then cannot be traced
                  back. Google provides us with reports and may therefore be
                  considered our processor, but it also processes data for its
                  own purposes. Google may be able to draw conclusions about the
                  identity of visitors based on the data collected, create
                  personal profiles and link this data with the Google accounts
                  of these individuals. You should assume that this processing
                  takes place if you consent to the use of performance cookies.
